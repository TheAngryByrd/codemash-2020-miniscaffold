You have a brilliant idea for an open source library. You start this new repository thinking of how bright the future is with your code being use by others. Then reality then sets in. You realize to make all this possible you have to do a lot of non-feature work. You need a project structure, a test framework, a build system, dependency management, continuous integration, deployment, and other tooling. All this is getting in the way of writing a great library you know will change the world! What if I said you can do all this and more? This talk will cover [MiniScaffold](https://github.com/TheAngryByrd/MiniScaffold), a dotnet template for getting your project up and running with little effort so you can create the libraries of your dreams.
